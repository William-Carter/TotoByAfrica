# TotoByAfrica
Program so you can play the chorus of africa at any time without having to cut out any of the amazing song.

Requires pygame.

The africa.wav file is not included due to copyright, so you will need to fetch that yourself. Other than that, there are a few options for customization. The main one is just adjusting the timebefore values up the top so that they match the start time of your song's chorus, meaning it'll work with any .wav file as long as you adjust the pygame code to import the right file.
